	<td id="desc"><b>1. If you're going to get a puppy, ask 
	yourself and your family some questions.</b> Are you ready
	to make a commitment? Do you have enough time on your
	hands for a dog? Remember, taking care of a dog is a 
	full time job. They're trusting you to make their 
	lives fulfilled! .</td>

	<td id="desc" style="padding-right:75px;"><b>2. If you
	already have a puppy and your dog is happy and calm,
	your puppy is in great shape.</b> Is there anything you 
	think you can improve on? If not, you probably don't 
	need this article. However, if your puppy has some bad
	habits you want to break, you can look at other
	articles on wikiHow which could help fix their bad
	habits. </td>

	<td id="desc"><b>3. Exercise is important! </b>It's the 
	best way to keep your dog calm. You don't want a puppy
	bounding all around the house because they don't get 
	enough exercise. It could also lead to aggression
	later on in their lives. There are many ways you can
	give your dog exercise that they'll love. You can play
	ball with them on a huge open field or a golf course
	(when it's closed later on in Fall). If you like to 
	go for morning runs, bring him/her with you! Walks
	two times a day is great too. They should get
	exercise two times a day anyways. Depending on your
	puppy's breed, size and age, the amount of exercise
	needed will vary.  .</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td id="desc" style="padding-right:75px;"><b>4. Enforce
	some rules! </b>There will definitely be behaviors 
	you do not want your dog to have. However you must 
	be consistent all the time when disciplining your dog.
	For example, if your dog likes to jump up on you, 
	just push them off, say NO, and walk away. In time,
	your dog will get the message and won't continue 
	to jump on people.<br><br>
	- Don't let your dog beg, and never give him/her food.
	It's a bad habit and make them understand it will not
	be tolerated, and it doesn't work. <br><br>
    - No barking either. This can scare away people and
	it may become a bad habit that might take a little
	while to fix. Give them more exercise too, because
	that may be part of the problem. 
    - Try to fix any bad habits you don't like. Keep in
	mind, the ones above are simply examples of possible
	habits your dog may have.

	puppy or dog be happier and balanced. </td>

	<td id="desc"><b>7. Give your dog as much affection
	and love as you want! </b>It's a good part of the
	relationship but don't give them affection if they're
	doing something you don't want them to do, or else it
	will reinforce the behavior. Like begging or jumping 
	up on you for example.  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td id="desc" style="padding-right:75px;"><b>8. Make sure your 
	dog is calm and submissive before you give them 
	anything. </b>That way, they'll learn they'll only
	get what they need by being calm and submissive.
	You'll know when they are. Their ears will be back, 
	tail down low and wagging, and their body will be 
	relaxed. There's a difference between scared and 
	submissive. If your dog is scared, her ears are back,
	tail between the legs, and sometimes cowering or 
	shaking or just plain tense (not necessarily).  </td>

	<td id="desc"><b>9. Have fun! </b>Dogs are great to have,
	just a big responsibility. Remember, your dog won't 
	live forever, so while you have him/her, make the 
	most of it!  </td>
