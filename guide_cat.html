	and decide if you want a male or female. </b>Male cats 
	can be more outgoing but more likely to pee on things.  .</td>

	<td id="desc"><b>3. Unless you want to breed your cat, 
	which should be done only with exceptional pedigreed 
	cats and requires a lot of work (including to keep 
	your cat from breeding untimely) </b>, spay or neuter
	it. The cat will be tamer and spay/neutering
	decreases the risk of your new cat developing
	certain cancers. Most vets do not allow you to 
	spay or neuter your kitty until they weigh about
	two pounds.</td>

<tr>
	<td id="desc" style="padding-right:75px;"><b>4. Buy 
	a litter box. </b>Remember to remove solids (feces) 
	daily. Empty it thoroughly when it smells bad overall.
	When you have to refill the litter box, pour 2–3 
	inches (5.1–7.6 cm) in.

	<td id="desc"><b>5. Groom. </b>Depending on the breed, 
	you may need to brush your kitty more often,
	but all breeds need to be brushed at least weekly.
	With Persians, it's 3-4 times a week, with Sphinx 
	(bald) cats, you need to give them 1 bath a week 
	(this is because their hair oils tend to build up 
	on the skin). Be sure to look up your breed to see
	what you should do. Short or medium hair mongrel 
	cats need brushing weekly or so to eliminate tangles
	and reduce spare hair that would rub off on furniture
	or form hairballs; they do not need bathing unless 
	something unusually foul gets on them.  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td id="desc" style="padding-right:75px;"><b>6. If you
	want a cat that is low-maintenance, you should get
	American Shorthair, </b> or any other kind of short-haired
	cat. Short haired cats usually only need 1 brushing a 
	week </td>

	<td id="desc"><b>7. Remember to clip the claws 
	every week, particularly if the cat does not
	regularly go outside where it might wear down
	the nails with vigorous activity. </b>Put the clippers
	perpendicular to the claws. The "quick" (finger tip)
	of the nail should not be cut. See where it is on 
	light-colored nails and avoid it; on dark-colored 
	nails, cut a little of the nail tip at a time if it
	is greatly overgrown and the quick will draw back
	over time.   </td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td id="desc" style="padding-right:75px;"><b>8. Buy cat food
	(canned or dry is fine, though dry food will help 
	keep your cat's teeth healthy), a food bowl, and a
	water dish. </b>You can find a food/water dish in any
	pet store. Feed your cat 2-3 times a day. You can 
	share little bits of many kinds of human food with 
	your cat but feed it in its plate or on the floor so 
	it doesn't learn to share uninvited.   </td>

	live in any flea-worthy area you can buy a flea 
	collar to kill/repel fleas. </b>Another option,
	which your veterinarian will most likely recommend,
	is to apply a flea repellent treatment (Frontline and
	Trifexis are two popular options). </td>
